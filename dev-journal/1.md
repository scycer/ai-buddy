# Node flow in Node.js

A node is a self contained function that either does io or pure function calls.

File naming convention:
<node-name>.<io/pure>.ts

It is validated on the outside using zed schemas. And we develop firstly using input/output schemas and a acceptance criteria of what it should do and if its pure or io.

These nodes are then linked together via a node graph.

## Node ideas
- Start with a simple console.log('Hello, world!') node
