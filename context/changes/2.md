# Basic one way chat

- Make a very simple chat interface in Chat.tsx.
  - It should be a chat UI with a list of "threads", creating a new thread is a new DB thread record.
  - In the thread, each message the user submits should send a convex action to the backend to submit the next message in the messages table linked to the thread. That message should be appended to a chat thread.
- The chat UI should then render this thread and messages using a convex query
